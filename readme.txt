|  Final Website Project Documentation  |
|_______________________________________|

The website took a long time to make but I made it.
I tried to mimic the website style from playvalorant.com to my website.
The website has a total of 5 main web pages plus a link to the old Web Project.
The 5 main web pages all have CSS elements and a working navigation wrapper.
I'm not sure what else to write in this documentation.
