      <!--Need-->
      <h1>Need</h1>
      <p>This site can be a log of a student's development throughout this
      course and can be used to showcase<br />
      what students will be able to learn by taking this course.
      <!--Rationale/Focus-->
      <h1>Rationale/Focus</h1>
      <p>This website will show students what they can expect to be able to do in
      HTML as the weeks go by in this <br />
      course, and will be used to showcase what I've learned too.</p>
      <!--Main elements outline-->
      <h1>Main elements outline</h1>
      <p>This site will feature this overview home page with a navigation link to
      the other pages, a development <br />
      schedule, an archive of old website versions, and two other pages that are
      still in development.</p>
      <!--Content-->
      <h1>Content</h1>
      <p>There should be about 5 web pages, and that's not including pages from
      old versions of the Website Project that will be found in the Archive.</p>
      <!--Target audience-->
      <h1>Target audience</h1>
      <p>The target audience will be teachers, students, and prospective employers
      for future jobs and internships.</p>
      <!--Design considerations-->
      <h1>Design considerations</h1>
      <p>As the weeks go on, I hope to be able to have this site looking very neat,
      a bit minimilistic and modern looking.</p>
      <!--Development schedule, milestones, deliverables-->
      <h1>Development schedule, milestones, deliverables</h1>
      <p>This website will have a <a href="dev_schedule.html" target="_blank">development
      schedule</a> that will keep track of the changes to the site as the weeks
      go by.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        In this page, you'll find me using the HTML skills I've learned
        throughout this course in order<br />
        to fulfill the requirements of project 2. I'm still confused as to what I
        need to do for this project though.<br/>
        I made these pages myself and am resposible for all of them.
        </p>
        <p>This site can be a log of a student's development throughout this
        course and can be used to showcase<br />
        what students will be able to learn by taking this course. Student's
        who've never taken this HTML<br />
        course can be the audience as they can get an idea of what they'll learn.
        There should be at least 5 <br />
        pages of content that's required as per the instructions given for the
        project, and that's not<br />
        including the pages from the previous project iterations that will be
        saved and viewable here.<br />
        The site would have a page with the development schedule, an archive
        showcasing the previous<br />
        versions of the Website Project, and maybe 2 or 3 more pages with
        different content that will<br />
        fulfill different purposes and maybe have a different target audience and
        all that.
